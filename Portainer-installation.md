## Portainer

[Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) is a multi-cluster and multi-device support means you can manage environments of any type, anywhere (Docker and Kubernetes, running on dev laptops, in your DC, in the cloud, or at the edge), and we don't require you to run any specific Kubernetes distro.
